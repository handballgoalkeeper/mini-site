                    Mihajlo Idvorski Pupin, Ph.D., LL.D. (Serbian Cyrillic: Михајло Идворски Пупин; 9 October 1858 – 12 March 1935),
                    also

                    Pupin is best known for his numerous patents, including a means of greatly extending the range of long-distance
                    telephone communication by placing loading coils (of wire) at predetermined intervals along the transmitting
                    wire
                    (known
                    as "pupinization").
                </p>
                <p>
                    Pupin was a founding member of National Advisory Committee for Aeronautics (NACA) on March 3, 1915, which later
                    became
                    NASA.
